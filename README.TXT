Project "house"

I am recreating a House project
    
This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

This project is often used after studying the "shapes" project. It
adds a class to those ones in "shapes". That class (named "Picture")
uses the shapes to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with 
modifying source code.
